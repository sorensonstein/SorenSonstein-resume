        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third-year psychology student at the University of California Riverside. My interests include Soccer, film, sports, food, and discussions of the origin of the universe. I hope to someday become a licensed practitioner of psychological therapy where ever the opportunity may present itself. My favorite soccer team is the Chelsea Football Club, based out of West London U.K. A lifetime dream of mine is to someday be involved in the world of Football (soccer) regardless of what position. Under ideal circumstances, I would be able to serve as a sports psychologist for any professional Football organization with an available position. I feel as though my professional strengths adhere to interaction with other individuals in a setting where resolution and problem-solving are regularly needed. By utilizing the intersecting passions I hold for both the field psychology, as well as Football, I believe I would be in the best position possible for myself to progress as an individual and as a professional. My current education has reached the extent of high school graduates, but I intend to pursue Academic merits more closely to that of a master's degree. I am set to receive my Bachelors Degree in psychology come June of 2022, subsequently, I will pursue a graduate program with the hopes of establishing my self as a qualified member of the sports psychology field, so as to secure employment that would fulfill my overarching goals. My current professional experience in the psychology field has been limited due to undergraduate studies occupying most of 
my time, however, I have gained experience in the workforce via my participation in a variety of organizations. I gained my primary workforce experience during a two and a half year spell at In-N-Out burger, in which I started as a cashier and progressively increased the importance of my role at the company to tasks more in the realm of customer service and food preparation. Secondly, I have been intermittently employed at Bob Baker Subaru/Volkswagen previously as a lot porter. Lot porter requires experience with automotive equipment and vehicles, as well as prioritization skills. This June I intended to re-engage my employment at Bob Baker as a member of the BDC department. BDC entails online/phone interaction with customers in order to facilitate greater customer engagement with the physical dealership location. In addition to the employment experience listed, I have also engaged in volunteer work at my former middle school. I took on the role of an assistant goalkeeper coach, in which I was responsible for facilitating tryouts, physical conditioning, technical/tactical coaching. I maintained this position over the course of four years, which enabled me to develop the skills necessary for leadership and instruction; because of this experience, I feel as though I have been able to propel myself more efficiently in professional environments per result of the teamwork skills I have obtained. Thanks to professor Gustafson for giving me the context to create this resume utilizing HTML, I hope to further my experience with computer science in the future.<br><br>
